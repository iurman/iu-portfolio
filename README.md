# My Portfolio

Portfolio and About Me about me, Isaac Urman.

I have only used GitHub for in school assignments so if there are issues with the way things are formatted or set up and there will be issues, they will be fixed over time as I learn.

Currently I am using a Gatsby template for my portfolio and will continue working on learning Gatsby to include more custom features.

In the future I hope to refractor the website to be completely written by me.
