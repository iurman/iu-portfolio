### Heres some more info about me
I am pursuing a Bachelor's Degree with a major in Computer Science and a Minor in Data Science at Wentworth Institute of Technology, Boston, MA. I am interested in pursuing a career in Machine Learning as well as exploring how we can use it to further fields such as automation and medicine.

I have experience with Python, HTML, CSS, JS, React, Java, C, MySQL, Perl, and multiple distributions of Linux. I am also proficient with both Office365 and Google suites, managing and administering policies and rules to fit businesses needs, while maintaining a strong security posture. At my current job I am in charge of managing a database and integrating multiple services and software to work together such as SharePoint, Netsuite, and Teams.

I used to work as a Computer Assembly Technician I at my current job, where I worked on assembling, imaging, and configuring a variety of computers, servers, and panel PC's. When needed I still help out with certain builds. On the side I am working on developing a health and fitness application I started developing during a course last semester. I have been working on integrating GPT technology into the application to further my understanding of Machine Learning and AI.
