# Developing LAP: Lift and Progress


## The Beginning

Starting with knowledge of developing very simple applications and websites, developing LAP seemed to be no difficult task. My peer Darrian Yang and I decided to work together to develop a health and fitness application for our Software Engineering course that could act as your one stop solution for any and all of your health and fitness needs. Little did we know of what troubles we would face as well as how our final product for the project would differ from our vision.

## Planning Stages

Our first step for this project was deciding what architectural model that we would like to use for our application. We settled on an MVC *(Model-view-controller)* seen below...
