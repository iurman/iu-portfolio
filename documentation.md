# Starting Steps

Currently working on refractoring as well as most likely doing an overall redesign of my portfolio site.

1. **Step one** *is to document the changes and my thought process*
    * I believe that will be important to look back on as well as it will allow me to have a space tied to my project that tracks my thought process.
2. **Step Two** *would be to plan out and get a rough design of what I want the website to look like*
    * I have done this and now based off of that I will go back and look at what framework I should use.
    * Most likely I will do a redesign of this, but as it stands this is the current re-design of the site: [Figma](https://www.figma.com/file/xsTrR0J9n8g70x7lXDeZcO/Figma-basics?type=design&node-id=1669%3A162202&mode=design&t=fw1v1VEIOoCSpGpP-1)
3. **Python + Flask + React** *some thoughts*
    * Did some research and stumbled upon Flask while working on my Senior Project Journey.
    * Will attempt to re-do my portfolio using Python, Flask, and React, to allow for easy editing and modification.
